                        <p>The Cause, is ending world hunger. Estimates of how much money it would take to end world hunger range from $7 billion to $265 billion per year.

                        <p>Burning Vison believes that humanity already produces more then enough food for everyone. The problem is that the food is not distrubted evenly over the world. This causes suffering in districts of countries. Burning Visions wants to solve this world problem by raising money for setting up a transporting plan and put this plan out in action. With this plan the food will be properly transported to regions were this does not happen yet. By making sure the food will be transported peopel that are sufferign from hunger will then be able to get enough food to live a healthy life. But why helping and donating money to our Cause and not to other (non-profit) organisations? The answer is simple, we are not corrputed. The donated money will go straight to the piggy bank of The Cause. Aside the donations, whenever you purchae a product from Burning visiosn, will it be a boardgame or some type of merch, 10% of it will go to the piggy bank of The Cause.</p>
                        <p>If a big investor or comapny is reading this who is intersted in helping/sponsoring our Cause and/or want to help setting-up the transportation plan, let us know. Because the world and we can use your help to solve world hunger. In the end world hunger is something we should coop together with.</p>
